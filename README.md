Data preprocessing

  1. For the Decision Trees Descriptive Classifier I used 2 methods of data discretization to the Project
     Data PD creating two data sets: PD1 and PD2. Described which methods you used.
  2. For the Neural Network Non -descriptive Classifier used the Project DATA - PD and I had a specified tool
     method of normalization.

Building Classifiers
  For each sets of data PD1, PD2 ( for Decision Trees), and PD (for Neural Networks) performed the
  following Experiments 1- 3.

  For each Experiment compared the resulting Descriptive Classifiers with each other and compared
  each Descriptive Classifier with the resulting Non-Decsriptive Classifier.

  Experiments 1- 3
      Experiment 1 : used all records to perform the full classification (learning), i.e. build a classifier for
      all classes C1- C6 simultaneously.
      
      Experiment 2 : used all records to perform the contrast classification (contrast learning), i.e. contrasting class 
      C1 with a class not C1 that contains other classes.
      
      Experiment 3 : repeated Experiments 1, 2 for all records with the most important attributes as
      defined by the expert only.
